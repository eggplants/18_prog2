This past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace.  As my
high-school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: "We must adjust to
changing times and still hold to unchanging principle's".

We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors
and as friends.  For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when
our differences, for a moment, are suspended.
