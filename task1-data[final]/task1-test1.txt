This past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for
peace.   In our own lives, let each  of us ask not just what will
government do  for me, but what  can I do for myself?  As my high-school
teacher,  Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: We must adjust to changing
times and still hold to unchanging principle's.

We meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors
and as friends.  For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when
our differences, for a moment, are suspended.
